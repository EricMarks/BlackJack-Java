BlackJack Game

A "BlackJack" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all other 21-point hands. To play the dealer gives two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face up while the other card is facedown (the hole card). The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21(busting).

Card Values
In Blackjack the numeral cards 2 to 10 have their face values. Jacks, Queens and Kings are valued at 10, and Aces can have a value of either 1 or 11. The Ace is always valued as 11 unless that would result in the hand going over 21, in which case it is valued as 1.

The Game
Based on yours and the dealers cards decide wether to "hit" or "stand"
